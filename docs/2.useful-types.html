# Who are you?  Where is Prof. Versoza?
## Good questions!

# Lists

---

# Lists
Good for grouping of similar type values together into one bundle and performing some batch process on them.

Some things you can do with lists:
```python
salsa_verde = ['tomatillos', 'jalepeños', 'garlic', 'cilantro', 'salt']

# grab the salt
last_but_not_least = salsa_verde[-1]

# pass the pepper
mild = salsa_verde[0 :  salsa_verde.find('jalepeños')]
mild = mild + salsa_verde[salsa_verde.find('jalepeños') : ]

# mix it up
import random
random.shuffle(salsa_verde)

# straighten it out and flip it in reverse
salsa_verde.sort().reverse()

```
