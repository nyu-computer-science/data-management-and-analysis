# Who are you?  Where is Prof. Versoza?
## Good questions!
We'll talk about it... it's going to be fine.

# Lists

---

# Lists
Good for grouping of similar type values together into one bundle and performing some batch process on them.

Some things you can do with lists:
```python
# list of ingredients
salsa_verde = ['tomatillos', 'serrano chile', 'garlic', 'onion', 'cilantro', 'kosher salt']

# how many ingredients?
len(salsa_verde)

# grab the salt
salsa_verde[-1]

# pass the pepper
mild_salsa = salsa_verde[0 : salsa_verde.index('serrano chile')] + 
                             salsa_verde[salsa_verde.index('serrano chile') + 1 : ]

# mix it all up
import random
random.shuffle(mild_salsa)
mild_salsa

# straighten it up and flip it in reverse
mild_salsa.sort()
mild_salsa.reverse()

# treble the recipe
mild_salsa = mild_salsa * 3


```
