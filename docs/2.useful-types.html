# Who are you?  Where is Prof. Versoza?
## Good questions!
We'll talk about it... it's going to be fine.

# Lists

---

# Lists
Often used for grouping related values together into one bundle.
```python
# list of ingredients, recipe by Luis Alvarez y Alvarez in Bon Appetit
# https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tomatillo-salsa-verde
salsa_verde = ['tomatillos', 'serrano chile', 'garlic', 'onion', 'cilantro', 'kosher salt']

# how many ingredients?
len(salsa_verde)

# grab the salt
salsa_verde[-1]

# pass the pepper
mild_salsa = salsa_verde[ 0 : salsa_verde.index('serrano chile') ] + 
             salsa_verde[ salsa_verde.index('serrano chile') + 1 : ]

# mix it all up
import random
random.shuffle(mild_salsa)
mild_salsa
```

---

# Lists
Continued...
```python
# straighten it up and flip it in reverse
mild_salsa.sort()
mild_salsa.reverse()

# treble the recipe
mild_salsa = mild_salsa * 3

# did we take out the chiles?
'serrano chile' not in mild_salsa

# is the tomatillo still there, at least?
'tomatillos' in mild_salsa
```

---

# Lists
Continued...
```python
# what ingredients should we buy?
unique_ingredients = set(mild_salsa)

# how much of each?
print('MILD SALSA VERDE - SHOPPING LIST')
for ingredient in unique_ingredients:
    num_to_buy = mild_salsa.count(ingredient)
    print( '* {} x {}'.format(ingredient, num_to_buy).title() )
```

# Tuples

---

# Tuples
Like lists, but immutable.

Often used for grouping of somewhat unrelated values together into one immutable bundle.
```python
features = ('immutable', 'rigid', 'efficient', 'be careful!')

my_favorites = (features[0], features[-1])
# fine!

features[1] = 'flexible'
# crash!

features.append('hashable')
# crash!

features.pop()
# crash!

features.reverse()
# crash!
```

---

# Tuples
Can be written in shorthand

```python
x = (1, 2, 3)
type(x)
```

Is the same as...

```python
x = 1, 2, 3
type(x)
```

Both tuples.

# Other Sequence types

---

# Other Sequence types
All of these can be indexed numerically, sliced and diced, and looped through with `for` loops:
- strings
- lists
- tuples
- ranges
- dict_keys
- dict_values
- dict_items

---

# Other Sequence types
```python
# strings
for c in 'charicature':
    print(c)

# ranges
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

dining_hall = {'necessary': True, 'tasty': False}
# dict_keys
for key in dining_hall.keys():
    print(key)

# dict_values
for value in dining_hall.values():
    print(value)
```

---

# Other Sequence types
## Dictionary items
```python
dining_hall = {'necessary': True, 'tasty': False}

# dict_items can be unpacked into two variables
for key, value in dining_hall.items():
    print(key, '=', value)
```
```console
>>> necessary = True
>>> tasty = False
```

That's because each item is a tuple with two values in it.  See for yourself:
```python
for item in dining_hall.items():
    print(item)
```
```console
>>> ('necessary', True)
>>> ('tasty', False)
```

---

# Dictionaries

---

# Dictionaries
Key->value pairs.  Not Sequences.  Unordered.  

```python
dining_hall = {'necessary': True, 'tasty': False}

dining_hall['necessary']
# fine

dining_hall[1]
# crash!

dining_hall.reverse()
# crash!

dining_hall.sort()
# crash!
```
---

class: center, middle

# Sets

---

# Sets
Like lists, but enforce uniqueness of values.  Good for doing unions, intersections, etc of data sets.

```python
core = set('tomatillos', 'serrano chile', 'garlic', 'onion')
garnish = set('onion', 'cilantro', 'kosher salt')
salsa_verde = core.union(garnish)
print(salsa_verde)
```
```console
>>> {'tomatillos', 'serrano chile', 'garlic', 'onion', 'cilantro', 'kosher salt'}
```

```python
salsa_verde = core | garnish
print(salsa_verde)
```
```console
>>> {'tomatillos', 'serrano chile', 'garlic', 'onion', 'cilantro', 'kosher salt'}
```

```python
redundant_ingredients = core & garnish
print(redundant_ingredients)
```
```console
>>> {'onion'}
```

# Neverending arguments

---

# Neverending arguments
"Variadic" functions accept a variable number of arguments.

```python
def sum_however_many_args( *args ):
    print(args)
    print(type(args)) # tuple

    # add them all up
    total = 0
    for arg in args:
        total += arg

    return total
```

Try it yourself:
```python
result = sum_however_many_args(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(result)
```

---

# Neverending arguments
"Variadic" functions can require positional args.

```python
def sum_at_least_two_args(a, b, *args ):
    print(args)
    print(type(args)) # tuple

    # add them all up
    total = a + b # start with the required args
    for arg in args:
        total += arg

    return total
```

Try it yourself:
```python
result = sum_at_least_two_args(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(result)
```

---

# Neverending arguments
An arbitrary number of named arguments can be accepted into a dictionary parameter.

```python
def g( **kwargs ):
    print(kwargs)
```

Try it yourself:
```python
g(a=1, b=2, c=3)
```
```console
>>> {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

---

# Neverending arguments
And of course, with keyword args, it's possible to require a few positional arguments, neverending anonymous arguments, in addition to limitless, keyword args.

```python
def crazy(a, b, *args, **kwargs):
    print(a, b, args, kwargs)
```

Try it yourself:
```python
crazy(1, 2, 3, 4, z=1)
```
```console
>>> 1 2 (3, 4) {'z': 1}
```

# Unpacking unpacking

---

# Unpacking unpacking
The `*` before an an argument to a function call that is an iterable will break up, or unpack, the values into discrete values as separate arguments.

```python
x = ['Twas', 'brillig', 'and', 'the', 'slithy', 'toves']
print(*x)
```

This is what is *not* printed (but would have been without the `*`):
```console
>>> ['Twas', 'brillig', 'and', 'the', 'slithy', 'toves']
```

It's as if each value in the list was passed as a discrete argument to the print function.
```console
>>> Twas brillig and the slithy toves
```

# Functions of the finest order

---

# Functions of the finest order
Functions can be passed around the table, like any other data.

An innocent function:
```python
def bar():
    print('hello')
```

A not-so-innocent function:
```python
def foo(func):
    func()
```

Use the second function to call the first
```python
foo(bar)
```

This can be useful in some design patterns.

# Decorators

---

# Decorators
Not just to make your windows pretty.

Imagine this function:
```python
def meatify(old_func):
    def new_func():
        res = old_func()
        res += " with bacon, sausage, and pepperoni"
        return res
    return new_func
```

---

# Decorators
Functions that decorate other functions.

And this innocent function
```python
def make_pizza():
    return 'pizza is made'
```

Meatified by the `meatify` function
```python
make_meat_lovers_pizza = meatify(make_some_pizza)
```

Now to make a meat lover's pizza:
```python
make_meat_lovers_pizza()
```

This pattern is called the Decorator pattern.  The `meatify` function decorates, or adds features (perhaps undesirable) and functionality to the `make_pizza` function that don't exist in the original.

---

# Decorators
## Syntactic sugar
Now 25% more free!

Remember this innocent function?
```python
def make_pizza():
    return 'pizza is made'
```

And we decorated it like this:
```python
make_meat_lovers_pizza = meatify(make_some_pizza)
```

You can also decorate it instead with syntactic sugar.
```python
@meatify
def make_pizza():
    return 'pizza is made'
```

Now calling `make_pizza()` will call the meatified version.

# Classes and objects

---

# Classes
## Defining and instantiating
Define a class representing cats of varying cuteness.
```python
class Cat:
    # constructor function
    def __init__(self, name, cuteness_factor):
        # set the instance properties
        self.name = name
        self.cuteness_factor = cuteness_factor
```

Instantiate an object from this class.
```python
c = Cat('Paw Newman', 10)
print(c.name) # Paw Newman
```

You probably were taught that you *should* create getter methods
- Setters allow you to enforce validation on properties prior to setting them.
- Getters provide public access to otherwise private properties.

---

# Classes
## Getters and setters

Add some getters and setters into the class definition:
```python
...
    def cuteness_factor(self):
        return self.cuteness_factor

    def set_cuteness_factor(self, cuteness_factor):
        if cuteness_factor <= 10:
            self.cuteness_factor = cuteness_factor
        else:
            # raise a custom error
            raise CutenessOverloadError("{} is too cute".format(self.get_name()))
...
```

Use them:
```python
c = Cat('Paw Newman', 10)
print(c.get_cuteness_factor()) # 10
c.set_cuteness_factor(999) # CutenessOverloadError!
```

---

# Classes
## Inheritance

A generic Error class that inherits from Exception
```python
class CutenessOverloadError(Exception):
    pass
```

Handle errors
```python
try:
    cat = Cat('Chairman Meow', 88888)
except CutenessOverloadError as e:
    print('uh oh, this cat is too cute: {}'.format(e))
```
